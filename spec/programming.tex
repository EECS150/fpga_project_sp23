\section{Programming} \label{sec:programming}
\subsection{Manual Tests}
After programming, open screen to access the serial port:
\begin{minted}{bash}
  screen $SERIALTTY 115200
\end{minted}
Press the reset button (the right most button) to make the CPU PC go to the start of BIOS memory.

If all goes well, you should see a \verb|151 >| prompt after pressing return.
The following commands are available:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|jal <address>|: Jump to address (hex)
\item \verb|[sw, sb, sh] <data> <address>|: Store data (hex) to address (hex).
\item \verb|[lw, lbu, lhu] <address>|: Prints the data at the address (hex).
\end{itemize}
If your backspace doesn't work, try \verb|Ctrl-Backspace|

As an example, running \verb|sw cafef00d 10000000| should write to the data memory
and running \verb|lw 10000000| should print the output \verb|10000000: cafef00d|.
Please also pay attention that writes to the instruction memory .
You may try \verb|sw ffffffff 20000000| that writes to the data memory,
where \verb|lw 10000000| still should yield \verb|cafef00d|.

Once you're done, make sure that you close screen using \verb|Ctrl-a| \verb|Shift-k|,
or other students won't be able to use the serial port!
If you can't access the serial port you can run \verb|killscreen| to kill all screen sessions.

\subsection{Loading Software Programs}
In addition to the command interface,
the BIOS allows you to load programs to the CPU.
With {\bf screen closed}, run:
\begin{minted}{bash}
  ./scripts/hex_to_serial.py <hex_file> <address>
\end{minted}
This script stores the hex file at the specified hex address.

In order to run the software program,
you need to write into both the data and instruction memories,
remember to set the top nibble of the address to \verb|0x3| as follows:
\begin{minted}{bash}
  ./scripts/hex_to_serial.py ../software/echo/echo.hex 30000000
\end{minted}
Then, you should jump to the loaded instructions in your screen session by \verb|jal 10000000|.
In this case, as you loaded the echo program, you should see the characters you typed
sent back and printed on your screen.

After you make sure that your FPGA are executing the loaded program correctly,
reset your FPGA and try the mmult program in \verb|../softwar/mmult/mmult.hex|.

This program computes $S=AB$, where $A$ and $B$ are $64 \times 64$ matrices.
The program will print a checksum and the counters discussed in Memory Mapped IO.
The correct checksum is \verb|0001f800|.
If you do not get this, there is likely a problem in your CPU with one of the instructions that is used by the BIOS but not mmult.

The program will also output the values of your instruction and cycle counters (in hex).
These can be used to calculate the CPI for this program.
Your target CPI should not be greater than 1.2.

If your CPI exceeds this value, you will need to modify your datapath and pipeline
to reduce the number of bubbles inserted for resolving control hazards
(since they are the only source of extra latency in our processor).

\subsection{Target Clock Frequency}
By default, the CPU clock frequency is set at 50~MHz.
It should be easy to meet timing at 50~MHz.
Please try higher frequencies by decreasing the \verb|CPU_CLOCK_PERIOD| parameter
(starting at 20, with a step size of 1) in \verb|hardware/src/z1top.v|.
The unit of the clock period is ns,
e.g. \verb|CPU_CLOCK_PERIOD = 10| means 10~ns clock period and 100~MHz frequency.
Placement and route (\verb|make impl|) will take more time if you use a higher frequency.

If you found the following line in \verb|build/impl/impl.log|
(also displayed when \verb|make impl|), routing failed:
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
  CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-282] The design failed to meet the timing requirements. Please see the timing summary report for details on the timing violations.
\end{minted}
The detailed report can be found at \verb|build/impl/post_route_timing_summary.rpt|.
You may copy that file to the \verb|doc| directory for your record.
The section \verb|Max Delay Paths| shows the critical path in your design.
The slack is negative if routing failed, showing how much delay we need to reduce in the path
to meet the timing constraints.
The signals names may have been changed during optimization.
You may refer to \verb|build/impl/post_route.v| or \verb|build/synth/post_synth.v|
to figure out what they correspond to in your source code.
