\section{Setup}

\subsection{Creating Your Repository}
Create a repository for your team by accepting the GitHub Classroom assignment, the link should have been posted on Ed.
The first member needs to create a team when accepting the assignment, where naming of the group is up to you.
The other member should join the team created by the first member.

Your repository is initially empty,
Import the project skeleton as follows:

\begin{minted}[tabsize=2]{bash}
  git clone git@github.com:EECS151-sp23/fpga_project_sp23-<your team name>.git
  cd fpga_project_sp23-<your team name>
  git remote add skeleton https://github.com/EECS150/fpga_project_sp23.git
  git pull skeleton main
  git push -u origin main
\end{minted}

To pull project updates from the skeleton repository (you will be notifed through Ed), run the following:
\begin{minted}[tabsize=2]{bash}
  git pull skeleton main
  git push
\end{minted}
while you can pull updates made by the other team member simply by \verb|git pull| after the other did \verb|git push|.
Resolve merge conflict carefully if it happens.

Remember to push your changes to the remote repository frequently.
\textbf{We are not responsible for any loss of your data.}
No extensions will be given for that reason.


\subsection{Integrating Designs from Labs}
You should copy some modules you designed from the labs, overwriting the provided skeleton files in \verb|hardware/src/io_circuits|.

\textbf{Files to copy from the labs:}
\begin{minted}{bash}
  debouncer.v
  synchronizer.v
  edge_detector.v
  uart_transmitter.v
\end{minted}

    \item \verb|io_circuits|:
      IO circuits from previous lab exercises.
    \item \verb|riscv_core/cpu.v|:
      Your RISC-V CPU design goes here.
      Some modules are provided.
      Don't change the names of provided modules and signals.
    \item \verb|riscv_core/opcode.vh|:
      Constant definitions for RISC-V opcodes and funct codes.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \verb|sim|
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|asm_tb.v|:
      The testbench works with the software in \verb|software/asm|.
      The hex file will be written to the instruction/data memories.
    \item \verb|cpu_tb.v|:
      The testbench checks if your CPU can execute all the RV32I instructions (including CSR instructions) correctly,
      and can handle some simple hazards.
      This testbench directly edits the contents of the register file and the instruction/data memories for tests.
    \item \verb|isa_tb.v|:
      The testbench works with the RISC-V ISA test suite in \\ \verb|software/riscv-isa-tests|.
      We use 38 tests from the test suite.
      The testbench only runs one test at a time.
      To run all tests, run \verb|make isa-tests|.
      The hex file will be written to the instruction/data memories.
    \item \verb|c_tests_tb.v|:
      The testbench verifies the correct execution of the software in \verb|software/c_tests|.
      There are 6 tests provided.
      The hex file will be written to the instruction/data memories.
    \item \verb|uart_parse_tb.v|:
      The testbench works with the software in \verb|software/uart_parse|.
      It performs a simple write/read using the serial rx/tx lines.
      The hex file will be written to the instruction/data memories.
    \item \verb|echo_tb.v|:
      The testbench works with the software in \verb|software/echo|.
      The CPU reads a character sent from the serial rx line and echoes it back to the serial tx line.
      The hex file will be written to the instruction/data memories.
    \item \verb|mmio_counter_tb.v|:
      The testbench runs a small set of instructions and print out the memory mapped I/O counter values.
      This testbench directly edits the contents of the register file and the instruction/data memories for tests.
    \item \verb|bios_tb.v|:
      The testbench simulates the execution of the BIOS program in \\ \verb|software/bios|.
      It checks if your CPU can execute the instructions stored in the BIOS memory.
      The testbench also emulates user input sent over the serial rx line,
      and checks the BIOS message output obtained from the serial tx line.
    \item \verb|mem_path.vh|:
      Specifies the location of register file and memories.
      Some testbenches refer to this file to edit/check their values.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \verb|c_tests|:
    Example C programs for tests.
    You may add a new one.
